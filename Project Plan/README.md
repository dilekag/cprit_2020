# CPRIT Summer 2020 Project End Goal

### By the end of the summer, I want to have completed the following: 
1. Literature review thoroughly understanding our current knowledge of the spatio-temporal & general relationships between COVID-19 and lung cancer
2. Collected demographic and incidence/ death data regarding both COVID-19 and lung cancer 
3. Utilize R-INLA, Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and Bayesian poisson modeling to conduct statistical analyses on the data and cleanly model trends/ relationships
4. Utilize R-Shiny app/ dashboards to visualize the data and relationships to better understand the effects of lung cancer on COVID-19 and determine whether/ which of Texas' oncology resources perhaps need to make modifications to their methods of care for these vulnerable patients.  
5. Create a presentation/ poster that summarizes the findings from all of the above
