### Access to Data
In order to be able to access any of the data, one needs to receive data access approval (which I have already gotten). 
1.	Then, the person must download the following software to their computer (only takes a few moments): https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/download/
2.	Once it’s downloaded, open the SEER*Stat software, from the File menu, select New > Case Listing Session.
3.	On the Data Tab, you will be able to see all the different databases. 
4.	Once you output the table with the data that is needed, it’s very simple to “Select All”, then select Edit > Copy, and paste the table into an Excel file that can be easily read by R. 

At some point during this process, you will need to enter in the following user name and password to have access:

  - “The American Community Survey (ACS) Summary File is a set of comma-delimited text files that contain all of the Detailed Tables for the ACS data releases. Summary File estimates, margins of error, and geography files for each release are available via the Summary File Data page. The Detailed Tables are stored in a series of files with only the data from the tables and without such information as the table title, description of the rows, or geographic identifiers. That information is located in other files that the user must merge with the data files to reproduce full tables.”
